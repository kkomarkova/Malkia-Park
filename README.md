## About Malkia Park :tiger: 
Malkia Park is a place that rescues feline (cat) species from circuses and other
inappropriate conditions found in private breeding programs and Zoos. </br>

The rescue and everyday care of animals is incredibly financially demanding. To run
the park adequately they need more than 400 000 € a year. It is not an easy thing to
find the resources to fund the park. The financial issue of the business is critical. They
need more people to be willing to adopt animals and contribute to their care. </br>

Our goal is to analyse the business and to develop working app applying the knowledge
and skills that we learned this year. The initial version of the application consists of two
main parts. The first part allows users to find out more information about the animals
and their location in the park. Thanks to the second part, the user can adopt selected
animals directly through the application and financially support the park. </br>

We would like to be able to develop more features for the application. Ideas for improvement in the
future can be adding the possibility of donation directly in the application and provide
visitors more information about park services such as Kids World, Bistro, Guest House. </br>
